I received my A.B. from Dartmouth College in 2010 with a major in
chemistry and a minor in linguistics. I attended medical school at the 
University of Massachusetts from 2010-2014, then completed residency training
in internal medicine at California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco, CA
in 2017. I am currently a research fellow in the Division of Nephrology at
University of California, San Francisco, where I am also a Master's student 
in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics.
