Currently, I am currently a research fellow in the Division of Nephrology at the
University of California, San Francisco. I received my A.B. from Dartmouth College in 2010 where I majored in chemistry and minored in linguistics. I received my M.D. from the
University of Massachusetts Medical School in 2014, then completed residency training 
in internal medicine at California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco, CA
in 2017. I completed clinical nephrology fellowship and a Master's degree in Clinical Research at the University of California, San Francisco. 

My research centers on studying patterns in chronic kidney disease care delivery using large datasets. With the growing use of clinical prediction models to guide clinical care, my focus is on examining and quantifying the potential impact of this approach for clinical effectiveness and healthcare disparities.
